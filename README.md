# sci-fi-name-generator
This project will supposedly help me come up with a new company name. Unless I get bored and do something else with it.

`npm get-books` gets books from a hardcoded constant at the end of [this](get-books.js) file. It rips some book indexes (particularly author pages) from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) in a very dirty way that misses stuff. But it's "good enough"

This project is very lazy. Instead of a cli or library, I've been editing the [scratch.test.js](scratch.test.js) and printing things I want to test out to the terminal from there. There are examples in that file for various functions to generate names.
